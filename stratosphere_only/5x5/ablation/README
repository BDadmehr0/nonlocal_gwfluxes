Key takeaways from the ablation runs:


1) a 5x5 filter led to degradation of performance compared to 3x3. Does breaking down the 5x5 to 2 3x3 filters lead to a better performance?
Bravo, much better performance, much better R2. Although, found halfway that it uses 4 features: u,v,theta, and w

2) Learning rates of 1e-4 and smaller are generally good. 1e-3 can lead to spikes every once in a while - especially with u,v,theta.
